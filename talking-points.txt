AI is the branch of Computer Sciences that emphasizes the development of intelligence machines, thinking and working like humans. For example, Speech Recognition, Image recognition, learning & planning.

Machine Learning is a branch of artificial intelligence and as defined by Computer Scientist and ML pioneer Tom M Mitchell.  Machine Learning is the study of computer algorithms that allow computer programs to automatically improve through experience.

Deep Learning is a computer software that mimics the network of neurons in a brain. It is a subset of machine learning and is called deep learning because it makes use of deep neural network. 

A Deep neural network is a neural network with a certain level of complexity, a neural network with multiple hidden layers. Deep refers to a model's layers being multiple layers deep. 

An artificial neural network involves a network of simple processing elements (artificial neurons) which can exhibit complext global behavior, determined by the connections between the processing elements and element parameters.
